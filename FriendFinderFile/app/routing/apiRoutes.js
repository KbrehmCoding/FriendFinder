// Your apiRoutes.js file should contain two routes:
// A GET route with the url /api/friends. This will be used to display a JSON of all possible friends.
// A POST routes /api/friends. This will be used to handle incoming survey results. This route will also be used to handle the compatibility logic.
// You should save your application's data inside of app/data/friends.js as an array of objects.
var friendsData = require('app/data/friends.js');

module.exports = function (app) {


    app.get('/app/friends', function (req, res) {
        res.json(tableData);
    });


    app.post('/app/friends', function (req, res) {
        if (tableData.length < 5) {
            tableData.push(req.body);
            res.json(true);

// Determine the user's most compatible friend using the following as a guide:
// Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]).
// With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the totalDifference.

// Example:
// User 1: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]

// User 2: [3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]

// Total Difference: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

// Remember to use the absolute value of the differences. Put another way: no negative solutions! Your app should calculate both 5-3 and 3-5 as 2, and so on.
// The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.
// Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.
// The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.
