// Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]).
// With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the totalDifference.

// Example:
// User 1: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
// User 2: [3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
// Total Difference: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5

// Remember to use the absolute value of the differences. Put another way: no negative solutions! Your app should calculate both 5-3 and 3-5 as 2, and so on.
// The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.
// Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.
// The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.
