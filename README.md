# FriendFinder

Friend finder is an application that takes in information from a survey to best match it with a similar one submitted by someone else.

the answers given by the user are converted into an array so that it can easily be matched with a similar one.

you will need to have express and path installed in order to use it
it is made to be deployed on heroku
